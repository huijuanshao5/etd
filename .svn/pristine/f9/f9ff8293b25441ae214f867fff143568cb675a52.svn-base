%\section{Identifying Devices by Algorithms}
\section{Disaggregation Algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}
In most cases before energy disaggregation algorithms can be applied, a
pre-processing phase, which comprises its own set of algorithms, is
necessary.  
It extracts features or transforms data
from one domain to another, for example time to frequency.
In this section, we will first introduce pre-processing algorithms,  
give an overview of all disaggregation algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised), 
and explain the algorithms'  advantages and disadvantages. 
We also show computational cost. 

\subsection{Pre-processing: Event Types and Feature Extraction Algorithms}
\subsubsection{Event types of device features}
While conducting energy disaggregation, the events in a time series play an important part in identifying devices.
These events can be classified into two categories viz. {\em point-event} or
{\em vector event}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{Point Event}}. 
A point event is defined as an event that is determined by a single value from the input dataset and 
this event is used to characterize a device.
%If an individual data instance corresponding to an event is used to judge a device, 
For instance, examples of point events include real power, reactive power, or
power noise at any particular time. %  in a low frequency dataset. 

\item{\textit{Vector Event}}. 
A vector event is defined as an event that is composed of several data points that characterize a device,
instead of just one data point. 
For instance, the waveform of current or voltage is a vector event 
as it spans a period of time and cannot be captured by just one data point. When using vector events, if the raw data is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain, 
the extracted features are also treated as vector events. It a is common practice for current and voltage to be transformed into harmonics and 
wavelets. These transformations' representations as vector events better capture the data and provide more useful information. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Feature extraction algorithms}
Point events are easily obtained from the raw dataset which, for example, provides real power or reactive power time series. 
A commonly used event is obtained from the difference between two successive data points.
%We calculate the difference between the current value and the previous value to obtain event information. 
%we can calculate the difference between the current and previous real power.
If the difference is significant (above a threshold), a point event is generated. Otherwise, no event is recorded. 
%Similarly, the reactive power event changes are easily obtained. 

Since high frequency datasets provide rich information, it is quite common to extract vector events from them. 
It is done in the following manner. After pre-processing a time series from the high frequency data, 
we can obtain several features like the startup of current, current waveform, harmonics of current, 
current transformation, eigenvalue of current, 
voltage waveform, or voltage noises. 
Generally these pre-processing algorithms are classified into 
three types: 
{\em 1) basic signal processing, 2) Fourier transform, and 3) wavelet transform.}
Basic signal processing is used to filter, shift or amplify a time series data. 
%Given a time series data, basic signal processing 
%operates to filter
%can be conducted the following operations,  to filter,  shift, or amplify. 
Fourier transform converts the time series data 
from time domain to frequency domain, and  
harmonics are acquired from the result of the Fourier transformation.  
Wavelet transformation divides a time series into different 
scale components and each component is assigned to a frequency range. 
The features extracted by the wavelet transform are relatively stable.  
For instance, when a device is turned on, a corresponding sharp peak is generated 
in the time domain which is not characteristic of the device's power signature. 
But the use of wavelet transformation in the frequency domain will discard this transient information and be more consistent with the device's actual power signature.

%Wavelet has the advantage of
%not being influenced by sharp peaks which appear when some devices are turned on. 
\input{tab/tab_featureAlg.tex}
Table.\ref{tab_featureAlg} gives examples of several vector events using these 
three types of pre-processing algorithms.
Basic signal processing steps, low-pass filter, amplification and shifting 
are used to extract the distorted voltage shapes in~\cite{cox2006transient}.
In~\cite{wichakool2009modeling}, the Fourier transform of the waveform is applied to 
find distinct coefficients for those VSDs. 
The Fourier transform is also used in~\cite{jin2011robust} to extract the 
harmonics features. 
Wavelet transform is employed to identify harmonics features of devices 
in~\cite{chan2000harmonics}. 

\subsection{Overview of Disaggregation Algorithms}
As the number and complexity of features used have increased, 
%As more and more features are extracted from the recorded data,
so has the complexity of the 
disaggregation algorithms.
%vary from simple
%to complex.
From a data mining or machine learning perspective,
the algorithms are sorted into three categories:
supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised.
Table \ref{tab_algSummary} lists the three categories.
\input{tab/tab_algSummary.tex}

%So far, data mining algorithms focus on the
%low sampling frequency recorded data set.
%Optimization algorithms is employed on both high frequency
%and low frequency data set.
%Signal processing algorithms are mainly applied to
%the high sampling frequency recorded data.
%Figure\ref{fig_algFlowchart} describes the relationship of
%these three types of algorithms.
%Signal processing algorithms can run stand-alone to identify devices.
%Also, it can be integrated with data mining or optimization
%algorithms as the preprocessing part.
%Under the latter condition, usually the data is
%transformed from the time domain to frequency domain.

%From an events perspective,
%all algorithms are classified into point-based algorithms
%or vector-based algorithms, as shown in the 
%last column of Table \ref{tab_algSummary} under the Features Adopted category.

%\manishc{the table doesn't show if those algorithms are point or event
%  based. Also, an algorithm could use both point and event features.}
%\huijuanc{change as the following sentence.}  
From an events perspective, 
algorithms can be point-based, event-based or a combination of these two.    
Point-based algorithms are dedicated to the processing of turning on and off
events of devices. 
Vector-based algorithms treat the current, voltage or
power value as ordered time series instead of
picking up a single transition states. 
Point-based algorithms perform well on discrete steady-state
devices, but perform poorly on the devices with vector features, 
such as the variable speed devices (VSDs). 

\textbf{Comparison of Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms}
%\huijuanc{the following paragraph is added to compare the advantages and disadvantages of 
%supervised and unsupervised algorithms.}
We summarize the merits and shortcomings of supervised and 
unsupervised learning algorithms for disaggregation from 
the perspective of installation cost of meters, dataset size requirement for building models, 
computational cost of operation process, and accuracy results of disaggregation. 

Compared to unsupervised learning approaches, the \textit{advantages} of supervised learning algorithms are as follows:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item The disaggregation accuracy is higher when using the same dataset as input. 
\item They require less data set to build a disaggregation model. 
%\item Classification based techniques can make use of powerful algorithms to distinguish features belonging to different devices. 
%The classification accuracy rate increases with multiple features. 
\item  Once the model is trained, they usually have faster operation to obtain the output with same input. 
%The test phase works very fast since each test instance needs to be compared against the pre-computed model.
\end{enumerate}

Compared to unsupervised learning algorithm, the main \textit{disadvantages} of supervised learning techniques lie in that the labelled data of each device is hard to get because the cost would be very high if installing meters to monitor each device.

%\item The classification based techniques rely on the accuracy of  the extracted features of each device. 
%However these features  are hard to access in practice because of the meters that capture these measurements have a very high installation cost.


%To have a look at the algorithms and the features in detail,
%the major algorithms and the adopted features of each algorithm
%are listed in Table.\ref{tab_algorithms} in Appendix section.
