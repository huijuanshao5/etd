Electricity usage permeates all aspects of modern society.
Its most conspicuous
uses include urban contexts such as
lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration, heating, and, powering
appliances and gadgets but its penetration is pervasive across rural
and industrial sectors.
In 2011, the residential and commercial sector
comprised nearly 40\% of all the electricity generated in the U.S. \cite{energydatabook2011}.%\cite{www.eia.gov}.
Furthermore, our dependence on electricity will continue to grow
as emphasis shifts away from fossil fuel based vehicles to electric
vehicles.

While people generally agree on the importance of conservation and
usage curtailment, they are often at difficulties to quantify 
{\em where, when} and {\em how much} electricity is consumed.
Typically, residences and businesses receive
monthly electricity bills indicating aggregate usage, with no information on
the breakdown of consumption by appliances/devices, time of day, or day of
week (this is an area in great flux, however). Research has 
shown that simply making such feedback available to users
can reduce consumption by up to 50\%, although typical saving 
are in the 9\% to 20\% range \cite{energydatabook2011}.

One obvious approach to determining the breakdown of consumption is to install
power meters in every circuit (and sub-circuit)
to capture consumption of individual devices in homes and
offices. Such installation is costly and intrusive, making 
this option unviable in practice. 
An alternate
solution, called energy disaggregation or non-intrusive load monitoring
(NILM),
first proposed by Hart~\cite{hart1992}, is to use analytics to 
{\em infer} the breakdown of consumption from an aggregate 
power measurement of a
site. This drastically reduces the number of meters required per 
home/installation, typically to just one. Furthermore, depending on the analytics desired, it is possible to
use the measurements already being recorded by a utility meter for
disaggregation, especially in cases where utility companies have deployed
smart meters.
Energy disaggregation is hence today a booming area offering both
challenging problems for data analytics and having practical relevance in a
number of areas including sensor networks and building analytics.

Another approach to save energy at home is to 
efficiently use electricity devices.  
In residential buildings, 
the biggest consumer of electricity is usually the HVAC 
(heating, ventilation, and cooling) system, which generally accounts for ~53\% 
of the buildings electricity consumption
\cite{energydatabook2011}. 
How to automatically starts up and shuts down HVAC is a key problem. 
One solution is to predict the occupancy at home 
by analyzing the activities of daily life 
inside the building. 
Based on the occupancy information, 
an automatic control system over HVAC 
can be installed to operate the HVAC. 

A related research to occupancy prediction 
is the non-invasive indoor activities tracking.
It predicts when a person at which room 
without installing the invasive cameras at home. 
It can help predict the occupancy as well. 

\section{Timeline}
The first research on the energy disaggregation has been finished although 
the work can be extended to time-based motif mining and 
the relevant probabilistic model. 
The second task of activity of daily life research is almost done. 
The proposed project is Non-invasive Indoor Activities Tracking. 
It will begin from this Oct. and end in next Feb.. 
The timeline of my Ph.D the is as Figure~\ref{fig_PhDtimeline}.
