\section{Conclusion}
Residential occupancy prediction is a hot research topic on controlling the HVAC. 
The accuracy of occupancy prediction influences the comfortability of persons inside 
the home and energy saving. 

In this paper, we propose the mixture EGH model and compare it with two other 
benchmark models, probability density function and kNN approach. 
The results show that it generally performs better than kNN to predict the 
occupancy and un-occupancy states in the workdays. 
The mixture model predicts well for the period of after person getting up and before person 
going out. 
The coefficient of the episode generative HMM models helps 
predict the exact leaving time. 
However in the case of abnormal events, 
kNN performs good because it can average the 
historical data. 
Even if there is an abnormal day, 
kNN can leverage it. 

In the future work, we will improve the occupancy accuracy by exploring generating the 
mixture EGH prediction parameters automatically. 
So far, the hand adjust of parameters is needed for better performance of EGH.
Further, we will continue on the holiday occupancy prediction. 
The occupant and un-occupancy patterns for these days are completely different. 
For some days, the person never goes out. 
Therefore the occupancy prediction can only be obtained from 
the date information.
