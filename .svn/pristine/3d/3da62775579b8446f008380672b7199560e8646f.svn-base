\section{Experiment Results}
We have conducted experiments on three datasets. 
The data is obtained by monitoring two adults' 24-hour activities at home through RFID.
The monitored events denote when the person is at which room. 
For instance, we may know at 7:00am person 1 is in the kitchen. 

There are totally three datasets, Study 10 from 02/10/2014 to 02/21/2014, 
Study 11 from 01/29/2014 to 02/07/2014, 
and Study 14 from 12/09/2013 to 12/21/2013. 


Firstly, we define the occupancy at home. 
Sometimes, the person goes out for several minutes then comes back. 
This type of un-occupancy event is \textit{not} what we concern. 
Note that our goal is to turn on or off the HVAC 30 minutes earlier. 
We define the unoccupied as follows: 
1). the person leaves the outside-front or outside-back for more than 30 minutes.
2). the person stays in the living room or dining room for more than 9 hours without 
any other activities.
3). the gap between any two events is more than 30 minutes. 

Secondly we preprocess the data by deleting those invalid events, 
where the end time happens earlier than the start time. 
Then we sort the events according to the start time. 
Another data cleaning is that we delete the events whose duration is less than 
2 minutes. This is very important preprocessing. 
A person may walk in the hallway or between the dining room and 
the kitchen very frequently. 
What we are concerned with is that where the person really is. 
If the person dwells in an exact room for less than 2 minutes, 
that means he/she just passes by the room, 
but does not to stay there to do something for long time. 

After cleaning all the data, 
we apply three approaches, kNN, PDF based and mixture EGH time prediction model. 
Similar to \cite{scott2011preheat},
we organize one day's date into 96 15-minutes intervals with mixture EGH model. 
Then we split the test date into three phases: 
(1) before getting up, (2) after getting up and before going out, 
(3) after going out and before coming back. 
Thus our problem becomes to predict when the person going out 
and when the person comes back. 
Corresponding to these four phases, we adopt three different approaches. 
For stage (1), the probability density function of going out and combing back event is calculated. 
For stage (2), a duration-constraint episode mining and episode generative HMM is applied. 
For stage (3), the probability density function of backing time based on 
the time-constrains going out time is computed. 

The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig_study10}, Figure~\ref{fig_study11}, and Figure~\ref{fig_study14}. 
Each of these figures include four sub-figures. 
Each sub-figure describes the occupancy or un-occupancy 
precision, recall, and f-measure 
results of a person on a certain day. 
The blue represents the EGH mixture model. 
The green represents the PDF model. 
The red means the kNN model. 
The x-axis means the number of known 15-minutes chunks of partial day. 
For instance, at $x=20$, 
we already know the $20*15$ minutes' data, 
we need to predict whether the left $76$ 15-minutes 
the person is inside home or not. 
The y-axis denotes the precision value, recall value and f-measure value 
from top to down. 
 
Figure~\ref{fig_study10} (a) and (b) in study 10 shows the person1 occupancy and un-occupancy results. 
mixEGH has the highest precision, recall and measure on the test day 02/20/2014 
for both occupancy and un-occupancy. 
The other two approaches are competitive and kNN performs better than PDF 
after the person comes back home after slot 72. 
Looking into the original data, we find that person1 actually comes later than usual 
in the training dataset. 
%In such case, mixture EGH performs best.  
%Figure \ref{fig_study10} (c) and (d) gives the occupancy and un-occupancy results 
%of person2 on 02/17/2014. 
In such case, EGH mixture model performs best from the perspective of precision, recall and f-measure. 

In Study 11, mixtureEGH performs better if adjusting coefficient of mixture EGH model. 
Figure~\ref{fig_study11} (a) and (b) in study 11 shows the occupancy and un-occupancy 
comparison results of person2 on 02/04/2014.
kNN performs the best from the perspective of precision. 
The precision of mixture EGH is very interesting. 
It's very low before the person2 gets up ,and grows high after the person2 leaves home, 
and becomes competitive with kNN after the person2 comes back. 
The reason lies in that, 
person2 slept late that day after 12:00am. 
Before sleep, person2 stayed in the kitchen for some time. 
The frequent episode $KZ$ usually happens in the morning time 
instead of midnight. 
The mixture EGH performance is not good before person2 gets up. 
kNN performs best because kNN approach doesn't consider the 
actual place inside the room and it averages the occupancy status in the past 
most similar 5 days. 
Even if the person slept late, 
he/she still got up regularly.  
%Figure \ref{fig_study11} (c) and (d) gives the occupancy and un-occupancy results 
%of person2 on 02/05/2014. 
EGH mixture model performs competitive with kNN. 


In Study 14, Figure~\ref{fig_study14} (a) and (b) describe the case of person1 on 12/18/2013. 
Similar to Figure \ref{fig_study11} (a) and (b), 
mixture EGH model doesn't perform well before the person1 gets up 
and the reason keeps the same. 
The person1 slept late and some confused episodes are generated. 
%Figure \ref{fig_study14} (c) and (d) describe the case of person1 on 12/19/2013. 
%kNN performs better. MixtureEGH doesn't perform well because 12/19, 02/20 the person went out again after coming back and staying home for some time. However the training data don't include such case. 


Generally speaking, the mixtureEGH helps predict when a person 
leaves home during the period of sleeping and leaving home and its 
performance is competitive to the kNN approach.
