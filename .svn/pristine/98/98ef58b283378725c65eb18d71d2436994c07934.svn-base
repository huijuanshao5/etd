\section{Abstract}
Conserving energy and optimizing its use has been a long 
standing challenge. 
Apart from the monetary benefits associated with tackling these problems, 
saving energy has significant positive environmental impact. 
For instance, can the HVAC of residential buildings be adjusted 
automatically based on occupancy?
In our work, we mine the people's energy activity profile to 
predict the occupancy of residential buildings. 
We show that our method, which uses episode mining for target event 
detection and a mixture of episode generating HMM (EGH), 
generally performs better than the standard kNN approaches used 
for this problem.
