%\section{Identifying Devices by Features}
\section{Disaggregation Features}
\label{sec:features}
%Previous surveys have summarized the features for energy disaggregation, primarily from an
%electrical engineering viewpoint [\citeNP{zeifman2011nonintrusive,lee2004exploration,
%liang2010load,zoha2012survey}].
%We target this survey for the data mining community and complement prior literature 
%by providing details of existing features and newer ones, and 
%summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of these features in disaggregation.
%and add the computational cost of each approach. 
%

%\manishc{like we discussed, focus this section on features, and move data
%  collection to later}
%\huijuanc{ok. already moved.}
In this section we briefly outline several features that are used in disaggregation and
classify them based on different types like AC vs. non-AC or steady vs. transient state. 
%Data collection methods and instrumentation used 
%We also present techniques and methodologies by which the data is collected to assist feature
%extraction for the learning algorithms. 
%\input{sec/setup}
%\subsection{Features Summary}
%To disaggregate devices from aggregated current, voltage, or power data,
%we need to first understand the basic features of electrical devices.
We presented
some of these features in section~\ref{sec:basic} like - voltage, current, real power, 
reactive power, harmonics generated by current and voltage. Some more basic and 
derived features
include: startup of current; waveform of current;
wavelet of current waveform; eigenvalue of current waveform;
voltage waveform; voltage noise; EMI
by gauging noise; electromagnetic field around the devices; 
duration time of power levels by calculating current and voltage; 
and time correlation of devices. 

%The features that can be extracted from a data set 
%depend on the installed meters 
%and the sampling frequency of data recording. 
%Current meter and voltage meter can show current and voltage values
%at the sampling points.
%If the sampling frequency is high enough, larger than several hundreds Hz,
%the waveform of current or voltage can be reconstructed.
%The noise data is recorded by a special plug-in meter, which is installed in some power 
%outlets instead of being installed on main service current or voltage electrical lines.

\input{figs/ACPowerFeatures}
Figure~\ref{fig_ACPowerFeatures} (a) displays the classification of AC power features.
AC power features are related to current or voltage.
These features can also be classified based on the stability of operating states.
The steady state refers to the stable state after a device turns on.
For example, real power, reactive power, and apparent power
are all steady state features.
Transient states refer to variable states during a very
short period of time when a device turns on or off.
Transient state features are generally derived from
the startup shape of current, voltage,
harmonics or harmonics transformations.
%\input{figs/transient.tex}
%Any current or voltage is the sum of a transient state 
%and steady state as a function of time. 

Non-AC power features are summarized in %Table. \ref{tab_nonacpower}.
Figure~\ref{fig_ACPowerFeatures} (b). 
%Figure\ref{fig_NonACPowerFeatures}. 
%\input{figs/NonACPowerFeatures}
These non-AC power features are classified into two categories - 
device-related and device-unrelated. 
%\manishc{call these device-related and device-unrelated features}\huijuanc{ok.Done.}
Device-related category includes electromagnetic field (EMF); 
operation correlation between devices and etc.
%\manishc{where is on/off duration of a device used as a feature?}  
%\huijuanc{in the paper of \cite{kim2011unsupervised}, the on/off duration is used in the semi-FHMM Model.}
The EMF is produced when certain devices are on. 
The device-unrelated category is comprised of 
date or time features, such as month of the year,
day of the month, day of the week and time of the day.  
Also, it includes the ambient temperature, which
plays a crucial role in determining the functioning
of the HVAC system.
%When the weather is hot outside - the cooler is turned on and in
%the cold season the heater is used. 
Further the device-irrelevant category include features like sound and 
light produced by an electrical device. 
A sensor can be installed near a device 
to record such features.  

\subsection{AC Power Features}
\subsection*{Steady state}
\iffalse
\huijuanc{comment out until huijuan's next comment}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_ACPowerFeatures}, 
steady states include real and reactive power from both 
low frequency and high frequency data, 
current or voltage from high frequency data, 
and voltage noise. \manishc{figure 11 doesn't show anything about high/low frequency} 
\huijuanc{agree. rewritten as follows.}
\fi
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_ACPowerFeatures}, 
steady states include real power, reactive power, 
current, voltage, 
and voltage noise. 
This data can be either read directly from meters
sampled at low frequency or calculated indirectly from 
high frequency voltage and current data. 
\iffalse
\manishc{in this sentence, are
  you saying the meters that sample at low frequency compute the real/reactive
  power, while the meters that sample at high frequency do not?} 
  \huijuanc{Yes, this is what I mean. Is it correct?}
\fi  
Suppose the basic current/voltage frequency of
AC power, $\omega$, is 60 Hz
and the sampling frequency of recorded data is $f$,
i.e., there are in total $f/60$ number of sample points in
each cycle.
The real power value is the average product
of current and voltage in a cycle as in Equation (\ref{eq_realpowerhighfreq}). 
\begin{equation}
P_{av}= \frac{\sum_{t}^{t+f/60} v(t) \cdot i(t)}{f/60}
\label{eq_realpowerhighfreq}
\end{equation}
%When introducing the angle phase difference between current and voltage, 
%we can also calculate the instantaneous reactive power according to 
%Equation (\ref{eq_powerTriangle}) in section~\ref{sec_pvCalculation}.
%\manishc{how do you compute the reactive power from that equation? It has
 % apparent power as well, where do you get that from?}

Real power is the most basic feature and used 
by almost all prior work in energy disaggregation \cite{hart1992,powers1991using,farinaccio1999using,marceau2000nonintrusive,baranski2004genetic,baranski2004detecting}.
Reactive power is also widely used as a feature, e.g., in \cite{hart1992,laughman2003power,drenker1999nonintrusive}.
Figure~\ref{fig_realReactive_hart1992} shows real power and 
reactive power features of different devices. 
For some devices real and reactive power are sufficient in distinguishing
between them. 
The refrigerator and water pump have similar reactive power but
different real power - thus using the real power feature, we can separate them. 
The refrigerator and the garage door opener have similar real power but different reactive power - 
thus the reactive power is the distinguishing feature in this case.
Steady state features are also derived from the variations of real or reactive power.
For instance, in~\cite{milioudis2013event}, 
the slopes of both active and reactive power 
are extracted as vectors. % as shown in Figure\ref{fig_ACPowerFeatures}. 


\subsection*{Transient state}
High frequency data, 
from which the current waveform or voltage waveform can be recovered, 
%\manishc{what does
%  ``reconstructed'' mean here; you are already measuring current/voltage at
%  high frequency. You may want to reword/explain.}\huijuanc{I mean the waveform of the current 
%  or voltage can be reconstructed. }
offers rich features that can be applied to energy disaggregation. 
These features include the startup of current, 
harmonics of current, 
harmonics of voltage, 
voltage noise and its transformations. 

\textit{Startup duration and transient power:}
Startup duration and transient power are recorded when a device is turned on. 
Usually a non-linear device, like a microwave, has such a distinguishing feature.
%\manishc{not clear what this means, please re-word}.    
When this kind of device turns on,
the power usage usually changes to a temporary high value for few 
or milliseconds, %\manishc{this is too high! do you mean millisec?}\huijuanc{yes. already updated}, 
then jumps into a steady state for a longer time.
This temporary startup duration and shape feature varies from one device to another. 
Comparing the transient power changes with the steady state, 
the trail of power changes against time looks like a spike or a curve with changing slope. 
Figure~\ref{fig_realTransient} shows examples of current, average real power and instantaneous
real power in the first 0.5 seconds of a refrigerator turning on in the 
BLUED dataset~\cite{anderson2012blued}. 
\iffalse
 \manishc{you said 0.5 sec in the previous
  sec; make it consistent, and this sentence seems like a repetition} \huijuanc{updated, and remove the repeated sentence}. 
\fi  
In figure~\ref{fig_realTransient} (a), there are three areas in this waveform.
When $0<t<0.02s$, the current is in
a steady state.
When $0.02s \leq t \leq 0.45s$,
the current is in a transient state,
during which the amplitude of the current changes
rapidly. 
%\manishc{the amplitude of the current is changing, but the frequency
 % doesn;t seem to change much.}\huijuanc{agree. updated.}
When $ t \geq 0.45s$, current comes again into
steady state.
Figure~\ref{fig_realTransient} (b) shows the shape of corresponding average power. 
\iffalse
\manishc{i assume this is average power? please call it average power,
  since you are talking about instantaneous power here as well} \huijuanc{done.}
It reaches around 400 watts for a very short period of time 
\manishc{i don;t
  see it being 400 W in fig 12 (b)}\huijuanc{deleted}
\fi 
It jumps to 1600 watts in a very short period of time, then gradually decreases to 200 watts. 
This real power is calculated by every cycle of 1/60 second by the Equation (\ref{eq_realpowerhighfreq}). 
Figure~\ref{fig_realTransient} (c) depicts the instantaneous real power. 
There are 200 points in each cycle. The instantaneous power changes very frequently.
\input{figs/realTransient}
The transient energy %\manishc{real power?} \huijuanc{change power as energy} 
is calculated as 
$E_{transient} = \int_{t_s}^{t_s+\delta t} v(t)i(t)dt $, 
where $t_s$ is the start time and $\delta t$ is the startup duration. 
And the corresponding real power is calculated as 
$P(t) = \frac{dE_{transient(t)}}{dt} = v(t)\cdot i(t)$.
\iffalse
\manishc{this is confusing, is ``transient power'' ``transient real power''?
  what is the unit of transient power? is it Watts? from your equation of
  $P_{transient}$ it appears to be Watt Second? can you verify these
  equations, and explain how transient power is different from real power. I
  initially thought that transient power is just the power during the
  transient period; is that correct?}\huijuanc{already verified the equation and changed it.}
\fi  
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%W_{transient} = \int_{t_s}^{t_s+\Delta t} v\cdot i \cdot dt \\
%\end{eqnarray*}

This startup duration and shape of current or power feature can be used 
standalone or by integrating with other features.~\cite{sultanem1991using} gives a typical example of the latter case. 
The startup duration and the shape of current or power feature 
is combined with real power and reactive power
to distinguish each device among refrigerator, washing machine, and fluorescent light.
Note that 
this transient startup may be called transient spectral envelope~\cite{shaw2000PhdThesis}, 
or transient power. 
%It has been applied in previous work
%as features to identify electrical device.(?give an example)

\textit{Current or voltage waveform:}
Current waveform $I_{ac}$, which can be simply read from
high frequency recorded data,
is a typical feature to discriminate devices.
The waveforms generated by non-linear devices  are 
very different because of the waveform distortion 
brought by each device. 
Figure~\ref{fig_waveformTraj} (a-b)
illustrates the current waveform 
of two devices, refrigerator and compressor in BLUED dataset. 
From them, we can see that both the magnitudes  and the distortions 
of the current waveforms differ from each other. 
The maximum current magnitude of a refrigerator is 20 Amps while that of 
compressor is around 16 Amps. 
%\input{figs/currentwaveform} 

Current or voltage waveform features have been applied in previous work.
Unprocessed current waveform 
%just like waveform in Figure~\ref{fig_currentwaveform}, 
is regarded as a feature in~\cite{suzuki2008nonintrusive}.
This paper shows that 
the raw current waveforms of a microwave oven and a toaster oven 
are different in a cycle. 
Therefore, these raw current waveforms can be used to separate 
these two devices. 
However, raw current waveforms are prone to change with noise.
Also,~\cite{duan2004neural} analyzes the current waveform of eight devices and classifies
them as A/C, refrigerator, compressor, 
fan (VSD), elevator (converter), elevator (M/G set), fluorescent lights 
and computers. 
Similarly, standalone voltage waveform is used as a feature in previous work. 
The distortion is mainly generated by non-linear devices.
By analyzing the voltage shapes,
we can figure out which device is on.
The difference of voltage waveform is that the maximum value of 
voltage is approximately 116V in the U.S.. 
\cite{cox2006transient} uses the distortion of voltage waveform to
separate transient shapes as described in~\cite{srinivasan2006neural}.
The combination of current and voltage waveform is proposed as 
features. 
 \cite{hassan2014empirical} shows that the disaggregation results perform better
 than adopting only either the current waveform or the voltage waveform. 

In order to overcome the shortcomings of raw current or voltage waveforms, 
several variations or transformations of these waveforms have been proposed. 
The first is voltage\_current (V\-I) or current\_voltage (I\-V) trajectory. 
It is useful because for
dynamic devices such as air conditioner,
the current waveform may vary from cycle to cycle.
Figure~\ref{fig_waveformTraj} (e-f) illustrates the current trajectory difference between 
two devices, %\manishc{what is a sequential device?}\huijuanc{not sure. delete sequential}, 
a refrigerator and an air compressor in the BLUED dataset. 
From Figure~\ref{fig_waveformTraj} (c) and (d), 
we can see that there is slight difference between the current and voltage. 
\iffalse
\manishc{not
  clear, do you mean in subfigures (c) and (d), there is a difference in the
  current and voltage waveforms?} \huijuanc{Yes. I mean little difference not much.}
\fi  
But comparing the current against the voltage as Figure~\ref{fig_waveformTraj} (e) and (f), 
the V-I trajectory is quite different. 
 %Circuit4 and dining room light. 
%From it, we can see thtat after the dinning room light is turned on, 
%the current changes some in the first half cycle. 
\input{figs/waveformTraj}
\cite{lam2007novel} utilizes 
the geometrical properties of V-I trajectory to sift devices. 
\iffalse
\manishc{some of the figure refs seem to be off, can you verify? also, in fig
  13, (c) should be (d), and can you label the two rows of plots with 'refrigerator' and 'air compressor' 
}\huijuanc{add the label.}
\fi

The transformations of 
current or voltage waveform, including the Fourier transform, 
 the wavelet transforms, 
and the eigenvalue decomposition are also useful. 
\cite{su2011feature} utilizes both the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) %\manishc{could you expand this?} \huijuanc{done.} and wavelet transforms. 
\cite{chan2000harmonics} employs the wavelet transforms of current or voltage waveforms 
to identify devices. 
%In the first stage, current or voltage waveform is transformed by wavelet transform.
%Then in the second stage, the wavelet characteristics of different devices
%are extracted and analyzed.
The eigenvalue of current or voltage waveforms is analyzed
as a feature in~\cite{liang2010load}. 
Figure~\ref{fig_eigenValue} depicts an example of how
two devices a circuit and dining room light
can be identified by eigenvalues.
These two devices both
have large first eigenvalues and small second eigenvalues. 
The difference between these two devices lie in that 
the first eigenvalue of the dining room light is larger than the first 
eigenvalue of the circuit. 
\input{figs/eigenValue}

\textit{Harmonics:}
Harmonics is another variation of current or voltage waveform. 
Harmonics are the integer multiplies of the fundamental frequency of the waveforms. 
%\manishc{but what are harmonics? could you describe that in a senetnce or two?} \huijuanc{done.}
They are generated by non-linear devices such as VSDs,
electronic ballasts for fluorescent lighting,
switching power supplies, or rectifiers
when these devices start up or after they are on.
These waveforms are distorted to
be non-sinusoidal thus reflect the inherent characteristics
of devices.
It plays an important role to help distinguish devices
when two devices share the same real power and reactive power. 
Harmonics can only be obtained from high frequency 
 data. 
%Equation (\ref{eq_harmonicsRange}).
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq_harmonicsRange}
%f < N_{highest} \times 1/60 Hz
%\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig_harmonicsFeature} (a) and (b) illustrate that 
an air compressor and refrigerator have similar real power. 
By analyzing the first three harmonics, 
each of them can be identified. 
The magnitude of the first harmonic of air compressor is larger than 
that of the refrigerator. 
And the magnitude of the second harmonic of air compressor is smaller than 
the magnitude of the second harmonic of the refrigerator. 
\input{figs/harmonicsFeature}

Harmonics have been employed in prior work 
\cite{laughman2003power,lee2005estimation,srinivasan2006neural,akbar2007modified,matthews2008auto,wichakool2009modeling}.
\iffalse
\huijuanc{will be deleted until huijuan's next comments.}
Some paper mentioned $N_{highest}$ as 11
because that's the highest useful harmonic for disaggregation.
\manishc{why?}.
Other papers~\cite{srinivasan2006neural} set $N$ to be 16 in order to capture more harmonics information
\manishc{but the previous senstence says that 11 is the highest useful harmonic}.
\huijuanc{change above sentences as follows.}
\fi
Generally only the odd harmonics are utilized. 
As the best of our knowledge, the highest employed harmonics is the 15 odd harmonics~\cite{srinivasan2006neural}. 
VSDs are hard to distinguish
but harmonics can be used to separate them. 
\iffalse
\huijuanc{delete until next comments of huijuan}
\cite{lee2003PhdThesis,lee2005estimation} thoroughly explained the approaches
as estimating the mean of higher harmonics of apparent power, 
then correlating the apparent power with the fundamental harmonic powers, 
thus identifying the VSDs \manishc{it is hard to understand this sentence,
  what is fundamental powers?  please re-word}
  \huijuanc{paraphrases as follows.}
 \fi
  \cite{lee2003PhdThesis,lee2005estimation} discovered that any VSD generates 
  a unique high harmonic power, which is identical among devices and effective for disaggregation. 
  Applying Gaussian random process to the power usage of VSD, 
  the $kth$ apparent harmonic power, 
  is calculated as $A_k=\sqrt{P_k^2+Q_k^2}$, where $k$ is an order number of harmonics. 
The correlation pattern between the real power and 
the $kth$ apparent harmonic power is detected as a characteristic of each VSD. 

The real and imaginary parts of harmonics are also fully used as features. 
Usually we only use the odd harmonics. 
The real part is calculated as 
$x_n=I_{(\frac{n+1}{2})}cos\theta_{(\frac{n+1}{2})}$ when $n$ is odd; 
%\manishc{how is the real part computed when n is even}\huijuanc{we only concern on the odd harmonics.}
the imaginary part is calculated as 
$x_n=I_{\frac{n}{2}}sin\theta_{\frac{n}{2}}$, 
for $n$ as even numbers, 
where $I_n$ is the magnitude of the $nth$ current harmonics and
$\theta_n$ is the phase angle of the $nth$ current harmonics. 
\iffalse
\manishc{are these equations only for odd harmonics? i vaguely remember that
  only odd harmonics are interesting. could you verify that, and find out why
  it is so, and include it here.}
  \huijuanc{Yes. That's the reason the paper of Srinivasan only mentioned the odd number of harmonics here.}
\fi
Figure~\ref{fig_harmonicsFeature} (c) shows the real part and imaginary part 
of the odd number of harmonics of a refrigerator. 
Also,~\cite{srinivasan2006neural} gives an example of how to separate devices 
by the real and imaginary part of harmonics. 

A variant of harmonics is spectral envelope. 
It is a short-time average of harmonics 
and was proposed as a device feature in~\cite{leeb1995transient,laughman2003power}.
Further, harmonics can be used in conjunction with other features to disaggregate devices. 
\cite{wichakool2009modeling} introduces a switching-function 
to identify Variable Speed Devices. 
\iffalse
\manishc{you use VSD in a lot of places,
  could you use the full expansion when it is used the first time, and then
  use VSD}\huijuanc{VSD has been explained in page 5. Is it necessary for us to list 
  all the abbreviations before the introduction section?}. 
\fi  
\input{figs/switchingFun}
Figure~\ref{fig_switchingfun} gives a comparison example
of current before and after rectifier and inverter of VSDs.
The operations of rectifier of a VSD corresponds to
a switching-function.
The current is initially direct current $I_{dc}$ and
after the current goes through the switching process,
then it changes to $I_a$.
The relationship between these two currents
is captured as $I_a(\theta)=S_a(\theta)I_{dc}(\theta)$, 
where $S_a(\theta)$ is the switching function. 
This switching function can be represented as 
a linear combination of different harmonics: 
$S_a(\theta)=S_0+\sum_n(S_n^p \sin n\theta - S_n^q \cos n\theta)$, 
where $n$ is the harmonic number, $S_0$ is the DC component,
and the variables $S_n^p$ and $S_n^q$ are the magnitudes of
the in-phase and quadrature parts of $nth$ harmonics of the
switching function. 
By comparing the Fourier coefficients with the $S_n^p$ and $S_n^q$ of harmonic coefficients,
these VSDs can be recognized.

\textit{Noise data:}
\cite{patel2007flick} and~\cite{gupta2010electrisense} recorded 
noise data instead of the current or voltage data.
Interestingly, this noise data
which occurs during switching on or off, 
can be used to identify devices
because different devices have different noise signatures. 
The frequency of the noise data is also treated as a feature. 
\cite{patel2007flick} first detects that noise is generated 
when a device in a residential building
turns on or off, or during the on state. 
With the introduction of switch mode power supplies (SMPS), 
the EMI generated by SMPS is also introduced as a feature~\cite{gupta2010electrisense}.
Figure~\ref{fig_LCDTVNoise} (a) depicts
the frequency generated by an LCD TV's on and
off events in the spectrum of frequency in the Kaggle dataset~\cite{kaggle2013energy}.
Figure~\ref{fig_LCDTVNoise} (a) illustrates the noise time series background in red and 
the noise time series with newly added noise in blue. 
Figure~\ref{fig_LCDTVNoise} (b) shows that the newly added noise is segmented. 
By analyzing the mean value and standard deviation of the segmented noise, 
SMPS devices can be identified. 
\input{figs/LCDTVNoise} 

%\manishc{can you increase the font size of the text in fig 17, it is hard to read}\huijuanc{done.}

\subsection{Features Beyond Current and Voltage}
%Besides AC-power values related to current and voltage,
%there are also additional features,
%such as time features,
%correlation between devices,
%electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by devices,
%and etc.

\textit{Duration or time of use}
The operation of a device may conform to
some routines when it's turned on or off,
and how long it's on or off.
The time of a device usage involves the
month of the year, day of the month, day of week, time of the day,
and season of the year.
Generally, fans and air-conditioners
work in the summer and heaters work in the winter.
Figure~\ref{fig_timeofday} shows that 
the total power usage of a commercial building~\cite{shao2013temporal}.
%\manishc{fig 18 caption should read 'day of week ...'}\huijuanc{done.}
Power usage is pretty high during the week day. 
In contrast, the power usage on weekends 
is pretty low. 
\input{figs/timeofday}
The date, time, and week features have been used in previous work.
For example,~\cite{kim2011unsupervised} points out that
a laptop is often powered-on in the morning of workdays
and TV works in the evenings and weekends. 
Also,~\cite{kim2011unsupervised} analyze the on/off
distribution of devices and finds that
they conform to Gamma distribution.

\textit{Device correlation}
Some devices may need to operate with other devices.
For example, the TV and XBOX usually turn on and off
together.
The correlation between devices is first
analyzed and integrated with HMM-based model~\cite{kim2011unsupervised}.
This paper calculates all the correlation coefficients and 
shows that 
both the correlation between TV and stereo
and the correlation between XBox and TV were as strong as 0.8.
\cite{chen2013novel} combines the features of on/off time, duration, and the correlations 
among devices to mine for usage patterns. It is designed especially for the correlations between different 
types of devices other than the devices of the same type. 
In the continuing work,~\cite{chen2014mining} develops an algorithm CoMiner to discover the 
correlation between devices. 

\textit{EMF, sound and light}
The electromagnetic field (EMF)
is generated by electrical devices
when they are powered on.
Different devices can produce different EMF.
EMF can be monitored by an EMF sensor around
devices.
It is used in~\cite{giri_study_2012}
to detect on/off state changes of devices.

In addition, the sound and light made by
the devices can help judge the status
of devices as described in~\cite{kim2009viridiscope}.
This work monitors the sound by the acoustic sensor 
at 4Hz sampling rate
to identify the compressor status of a refrigerator. 
Also, the light intensity installed in a refrigerator reflects 
whether the door is open or closed.

%%delete too long, unnecessary
%Figure\ref{fig_soundLightFeature} (a) 
%illustrates how sound measured by an acoustic sensor 
%identifies the compressor status of a refrigerator. 
%It shows that an acoustic sensor at 4 Hz sampling rate can detect the
%on/off status of the compressor.
%Figure\ref{fig_soundLightFeature} (b) 
%depicts the case that a light inside 
%a refrigerator monitors whether the 
%door opens or shuts. 
%It shows that light intensity in a refrigerator goes up when the door is
%open and the inside light is on.
%\input{figs/soundlightFeature}

\textit{Weather}
Weather is a key factor for a commercial building's power usage
because of the variation in the usage of the HVAC system in the summer and winter.
The correlation between temperature and electricity usage 
is studied in~\cite{pardo2002temperature}. 
%Figure \ref{fig_pardo2002temperature_temp} shows that, 
This work shows that
when the temperature is higher, 
the daily electricity usage increases. 
%\begin{figure}[ht]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=3 in]{figs/pardo2002temperature_temp.pdf}
%\caption{Variation of the total daily electricity load in Spain with the temperature index in 1998
%(courtesy: \cite{pardo2002temperature}).}
%\label{fig_pardo2002temperature_temp}
%\end{figure}

\textit{Other possible features}
Additional sensors, such as motion sensors~\cite{cook2011sensor}, 
can determine activity inside a building, and provide useful input to a
disaggregation model.
\cite{srinivasan2013fixturefinder} integrates data from electricity 
and other sensors at home to disaggregate  low-power 
devices such as light bulbs. \cite{wu2012low} proposes using plug-in low-cost outlet sensors to help capture 
appliance state. 
Also, ~\cite{uttama2013sustainable} uses limited plug-level sensors to improve the 
disaggregation accuracy. 
In the future, more sensors are likely to be available and could be leveraged for 
energy disaggregation.

%Other factors like price may play a role.
%When the electricity price increases,
%people resort to other energy instead of electricity.

%idea: to be used in future research, not mention it in this paper?

%Low frequency data means the current/voltage
%waveform cannot be recovered by the sampling data.
%High frequency data refers to those data
%from which the current or voltage can be reconstructed.
%%and can be obtained from both
%low frequency and high frequency recorded data.
%However normally reactive is Not logged by reactive
%power meter because the cost of
%reactive power meter is high thus not used in
%energy disaggregation.
%Even though, reactive power and power factor
%can still be calculated by calculating the
%voltage and current values from the high
%frequency data, which can recover the
%voltage and current waveform.


%%%%%%%%%%%%
%For any circuit, we can classify the current and
%voltage response as the sum of a transient response
%and a steady response.
%For any voltage or current as a function of time,
%it can be written in form of
%\begin{equation}
%x(t)= x_T(t)+x_{SS}
%\end{equation}
%page 192 in book \cite{courtesy: eebook1}
%where $x(t)$ can represent both current and voltage.
%$x_{T}(t)$ is the transient state and
%$x_{T}(t)=(x_0-\tau F)e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}$.
%$x_{SS}$ denotes the steady state.
