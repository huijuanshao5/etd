%\section{Identifying Devices by Algorithms}
\section{Disaggregation Algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}
In most cases, before energy disaggregation algorithms can be applied, a
pre-processing phase is
necessary, which comprises its own set of algorithms.  
This phase extracts features or transforms data
from one domain to another, for example from the time domain to the frequency domain.
In this section, we first introduce pre-processing algorithms,  
then give an overview of all disaggregation algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised), 
and finally present the algorithms' advantages and disadvantages. 

\subsection{Pre-processing Stages}
\subsubsection{Event types}
While conducting energy disaggregation, the events in a time series play an important part in identifying devices.
These events can be classified into two categories; {\em point event} or
{\em vector event}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{Point event}}. 
A point event is defined as an event that is determined by a single value from the input dataset, and 
this event is used to characterize a device.
%If an individual data instance corresponding to an event is used to judge a device, 
Examples of point events include real power, reactive power, or
power noise at any particular time. %  in a low frequency dataset. 

\item{\textit{Vector event}}. 
A vector event is defined as an event that is composed of several data points that characterize a device,
instead of just one data point. 
For instance, the waveform of current or voltage is a vector event.
When using vector events, if the raw data is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain, 
the extracted features are also treated as vector events. It is common practice for current and voltage to be transformed into harmonics and 
wavelets. These transformations are best captured as vector
events.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Feature extraction algorithms}
Point events are easily obtained from the raw dataset, which may provide real power or reactive power as a time series. 
A commonly used event definition is to rely
on the difference between two successive data points.
%We calculate the difference between the current value and the previous value to obtain event information. 
%we can calculate the difference between the current and previous real power.
If the difference is significant (above a threshold), a point event is generated. Otherwise, no event is recorded. 
%Similarly, the reactive power event changes are easily obtained. 

Since high-frequency datasets provide rich information; it is quite common to extract vector events from them. 
After pre-processing a time series from the high-frequency data, 
we can obtain several features, like the startup value of the current, the current waveform, the harmonics of the current, 
the current transformation, the eigenvalue of the current, 
the voltage waveform, or voltage noises. 
Generally these pre-processing algorithms are classified into 
three types: 
{\em 1) Basic signal processing, 2) Fourier transforms, and 3) 
Wavelet transforms.}
Basic signal processing is used to filter, shift or amplify time series data. 
%Given a time series data, basic signal processing 
%operates to filter
%can be conducted the following operations,  to filter,  shift, or amplify. 
A Fourier transform converts the time-series data 
from the time domain to the frequency domain, and  
harmonics are acquired from the result of the Fourier transform.  
Wavelet transforms organize a time series into different 
scale components, and each component is assigned to a frequency range. 
Features extracted in this manner
by the wavelet transform are relatively stable.  
For instance, when a device is turned on, a corresponding sharp peak is generated 
in the time domain which is not characteristic of the device's power signature. 
However, the use of wavelet transformation in the frequency domain will discard this transient information and be more consistent with the device's actual power signature.

%Wavelet has the advantage of
%not being influenced by sharp peaks which appear when some devices are turned on. 
\input{tab/tab_featureAlg.tex}
Table~\ref{tab_featureAlg} gives examples of several vector events using these 
three types of pre-processing algorithms.
Basic signal processing steps, a low-pass filter, amplification and shifting 
are used to extract the distorted voltage shapes in~\cite{cox2006transient}.
In~\cite{wichakool2009modeling}, the Fourier transform of the waveform is applied to 
find distinct coefficients for those VSDs. 
The Fourier transform is also used in~\cite{jin2011robust} to extract 
harmonic features. 
The wavelet transform is employed to identify harmonics features of devices 
in~\cite{chan2000harmonics}. 

\subsection{Overview of Disaggregation Algorithms}
As the number and complexity of the features used have increased, 
%As more and more features are extracted from the recorded data,
so has the complexity of the 
disaggregation algorithms.
%vary from simple
%to complex.
From a data mining perspective,
algorithms can be sorted into three categories:
supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised.
Table \ref{tab_algSummary} lists these three categories.
\input{tab/tab_algSummary.tex}

%So far, data mining algorithms focus on the
%low sampling frequency recorded data set.
%Optimization algorithms is employed on both high frequency
%and low frequency data set.
%Signal processing algorithms are mainly applied to
%the high sampling frequency recorded data.
%Figure\ref{fig_algFlowchart} describes the relationship of
%these three types of algorithms.
%Signal processing algorithms can run stand-alone to identify devices.
%Also, it can be integrated with data mining or optimization
%algorithms as the preprocessing part.
%Under the latter condition, usually the data is
%transformed from the time domain to frequency domain.

%From an events perspective,
%all algorithms are classified into point-based algorithms
%or vector-based algorithms, as shown in the 
%last column of Table \ref{tab_algSummary} under the Features Adopted category.

%\manishc{the table doesn't show if those algorithms are point or event
%  based. Also, an algorithm could use both point and event features.}
%\huijuanc{change as the following sentence.}  
From an events perspective, 
algorithms can be point-based, vector-based or a combination of the two
strategies.
Point-based algorithms are dedicated to the processing of the turn-on and turn-off
events of devices. 
Vector-based algorithms treat the current, voltage or
power value as an ordered time series instead of
focusing on a single transition state. 
Point-based algorithms perform well on discrete steady-state
devices, but perform poorly on devices with vector features, 
such as variable speed devices (VSDs). 

%\textbf{Comparison of Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms}
%\huijuanc{the following paragraph is added to compare the advantages and disadvantages of 
%supervised and unsupervised algorithms.}
I summarize the merits and shortcomings of supervised and 
unsupervised learning algorithms for disaggregation in terms of the installation cost of meters, dataset size requirements for building models, 
the computational cost of operation process, and the accuracy results of disaggregation. 
Compared to unsupervised learning approaches, the advantages of supervised learning algorithms are that the disaggregation accuracy is typically
higher (for the same dataset), they require smaller data sizes, and
have typically faster operation (in practice).
Compared to unsupervised learning algorithms, the main disadvantages of supervised learning techniques lie in that the labelled data of each device is difficult to obtain due to the cost of meter installation.

%\item The classification based techniques rely on the accuracy of  the extracted features of each device. 
%However these features  are hard to access in practice because of the meters that capture these measurements have a very high installation cost.


%To have a look at the algorithms and the features in detail,
%the major algorithms and the adopted features of each algorithm
%are listed in Table.\ref{tab_algorithms} in Appendix section.
