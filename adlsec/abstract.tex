Conserving energy and optimizing its use has been a long standing challenge. 
Apart from the monetary benefits associated with tackling these problems, saving energy has significant positive environmental impact. 
For instance, can the HVAC of residential buildings be adjusted automatically based on occupancy? 
In this work, we mine the people's energy activity profile to predict the occupancy of residential buildings. We propose a novel hybrid method, which uses episode mining for frequent events detection and associate them with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to form a mixture of Episode Generating HMM (EGH) for target event prediction, 
combined with the standard kNN approaches and demonstrate how this hybrid approach always yields the best results.
