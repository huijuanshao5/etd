Conserving energy and optimizing its use has been a long standing challenge. 
Apart from the monetary benefits associated with tackling these problems, saving energy has significant positive environmental impact. 
For instance, it would be useful to automatically adjust the HVAC of residential buildings based on occupancy.
In this work, we mine people's energy activity profile to predict the occupancy of residential buildings. I propose a novel hybrid method, which uses episode mining for target event  detection and a mixture of episode-generating HMM (EGH), 
combined with the standard kNN approaches and demonstrate how this hybrid approach always yields the best results.
