\section{Conclusion}
This chapter proposes an semi-supervised recursive multivariate piecewise motif mining approach 
to electricity disaggregation. 
%Before unsupervised disaggregation, 
We use a period of time's data to find the features of individual devices, 
including the power level and standard deviation.
Based on these features, 
we recursively utilize multivariate motif mining to uncover devices 
which draw power from both phases equally or unequally, 
then separate devices from each phase with motif mining. 
Large power devices are removed from two phases in the first a few rounds, 
which brings the benefit of decreasing the noise caused by large power devices 
during the process of disaggregating from single phase. 
Therefore more devices with small power consumption are separated 
in the piecewise motif mining from single phase. 
Also, this piecewise motif mining approach can identify
continuously variable loads such as heatingOutdoor. 
Besides, we apply motif mining approach to water disaggregation, 
it can separate water use ends which has a steady water usage state such as shower device, 
but cannot disaggregate those water use ends which consumes water variable for the whole 
cycle like toilet. 

In the future, 
on energy disaggregation we will use more features from the multiple phases' aggregated data, 
such as startup shape of individual devices.
For water disaggregation, we will explore on how to integrate the 
dynamic time warping with multivariate piecewise motif mining.
