%\section{Introduction}

In this chapter we re-define energy disaggregation to identify electrical devices from 
several phases aggregated data instead of the sum of all phases' data. 
To make full use of each phase's data and the power drawing correlation of devices 
enable us to uncover more devices.

%Our multivariate temporal mining approach extends previous work by combining both electricity and water disaggregation. 
This work has the following contributions in the field of disaggregation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item It can disaggregate multiple phases' aggregated data.
\item It can separate the continuously variable loads which are mixed in electricity. 
\item This approach can be used for both electricity disaggregation and water disaggregation.
%\item It can be used for supervised learning disaggregation and semi-supervised learning approach, even for un-supervised learning approach. 
\end{enumerate}
