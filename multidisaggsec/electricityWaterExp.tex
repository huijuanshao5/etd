\subsection{Electricity and Water Usage Correlation}
%From the above electricity and water disaggregation, 
%we observe that some devices, such as washing machine, use both electricity and water. 
%We extend our multivariate episode mining approach 
%from disaggregating two time series of hot water and cold water, 
%to three time series of hot water, cold water and electricity. 

We discover that water usage is more like a series of human behavior, as in Figure \ref{fig_bathroomBehavior}.
One person turns on the light L007 in the bathroom,  uses the toilet, flushes and wash hands,
accompanied by  taking  a shower and leaving the bathroom with the light turned off.

a series of events: light L007 on, down toilet on,  down toilet off, down sink on, down sink off, shower on, shower off, light L007 off. }
