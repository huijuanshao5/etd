\chapter{Conclusion}

Smart buildings research involves many topics. 
We focus on two of them energy/water disaggregation and occupancy prediction. 
In this work, we utilize temporal mining algorithms 
frequent episode mining to discover the usage patterns 
of electrical devices and water use ends. 
Based on these frequent episodes, 
we can disaggregate individual devices from the multi-phases 
or single-phase aggregated data. 

Also, we mine the frequent episodes from the room position of a 
person in a residential building. 
Then we connect these frequent episodes with HMM 
to build Episode Generating HMM for target event unoccupancy prediction. 

In the future work, 
regarding energy disaggregation, we will incorporate more feature 
when a device starts up and improve this temporal mining 
approach to disaggregate more devices. 
For water disaggregation, since there's limitation in 
discovering specific water use ends, 
we will explore temporal mining approach, 
and integrate the dynamic time warping with motif mining. 

As to occupancy prediction, 
the hybrid approach by integrating kNN and a mixture of EGH 
performs best on sensor data set. 
Next step, we will apply this approach to GPS dataset 
on occupancy prediction.
